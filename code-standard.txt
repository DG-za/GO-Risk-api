Introduction:-
--------------
We are using Angular as frontend with Angular 8
As backend, we are using Mysql with Codeigniter Framework with JWT + Rest Client and Rest Server. 

There are two main modules in that application:
1. Matuarity Module
2. Risk Module

For API:
--------------
1. Controller name must be written with UpperCamelCase
Like: DeleteEmailTemplate.php

2. Models name must be written with UpperCamelCase and suffix will be _model
Like: DeleteEmailTemplate_model

3. Controller method name must be written with lowerCamelCase
getAllActionvictory_post

At the end as suffix, you can use it as per your API type like: post,put,get,update,delete and so on.

4. Each and every tables have prefix with predefined modules: 

5. Each and every API have token and we are passing token when API call from the application.

For Angular Application:
------------------------
1. For sub modules we have used child method, it mean related files will be import in the related modules only.
2. Used specific services for the particular modules.
3. Angular function name must be written with lowerCamelCase
Like getMilestones

For Database:
--------------
1. All ommon tables must have prefix "com_"
2. All Maturity module tables must have prefix "mat_"
